# NF-Pixels

![NF Pixels logo](showcases/illustrations/logo.png)

A free pixel font focused on minimalism.

## Features

### Font design

This font was originally created to be used in a pixel-art game on iOS.

Some unique features make its strength:

* A simple design makes it very readable [even at small sizes](showcases/illustrations/readability.png).
* It covers all western european languages.
* It has a lot of symbols.

### Weights

NF Pixels only features a Regular weight at this moment.

A bold version is planned: #1

Obviously, there is no italic version planned, as it is quite hard to make it readable with a pixel fontâ€¦


### Ligatures

NF Pixels features standard ligatures to improve readability.
